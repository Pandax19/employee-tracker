### Description
    
The goal of this project was to replicate a database of employees, roles, and departments that would be accessible to a manager to view the requested data on a table within the terminal. This project utilized various packages, including sequelize, mysql and express. A user will be able to view all departments, roles, employees, add department, add role, and update employee role. Changes will reflect in table.
